# Orangutan

Whence Orangutan? In verity, we choose Orangutan because we are on Monkey Islang
and Orangutans are splendid great apes native to the verdant rain-forests of
Indonesia and Malaysia. Being engrossed in yonder task of writing an interpreter
in OCaml, it was natural to select a primate whose appellation doth commence with
an 'O'.
