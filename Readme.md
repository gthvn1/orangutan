# Orangutan

Whence Orangutan? In verity, we choose Orangutan because we are on
[Monkey](https://monkeylang.org/) Islang and Orangutans are splendid great
apes native to the verdant rain-forests of Indonesia and Malaysia.
Being engrossed in yonder task of writing an interpreter of Monkey Lang in
OCaml, it was natural to select a primate whose appellation doth starts with
an 'O'.
